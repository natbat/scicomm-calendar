<p>And what is a 'Twitter hashtag game' you might ask! Well, it's when people, often scientists and experts in their field pose a question such as "<em>is this photo a picture of a Cougar?</em>" #cougarOrNot or "<em>which bird laid these eggs?</em>" #WhoLaidIt etc.</p>

<p>To enter the game you can tweet your answer either as a reply to the game or a regular tweet so long as you use the hashtag of the game. To follow along with other people's answers to the game you can search twitter for the hashtag.</p>
